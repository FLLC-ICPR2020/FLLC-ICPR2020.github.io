      <description>Latest News  The 2nd grand challenge of 106-point facial landmark localization will be held in conjunction with the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2020, Milan, Italy. We will announce the registration URL on March 30, 2020.  Overview Facial landmark localization is a very crucial step in numerous face related applications, such as face alignment for recognition, facial pose estimation, face image synthesis, etc. We are hosting the 2nd 106-point facial landmark localization challenge in conjunction with ICPR 2020.</description>

      <description>Training data The dataset is an incremental of JD-landmark [1-7], consisting of about 20,000 images with 106-point landmark annotation. Different to JD-landmark, all of the incremental samples are from real-world data with human annotation, without any algo-generated ones. The images and landmarks will be released on March 30, 2020.
Validation data It consists of 2,000 images, covering large variations of pose, expression and occlusion, are selected from open source web face dataset [8].</description>

      <description>Detail Requirements  The upper bound of computational complexity is 1 GFLOPs. The upper bound of model size is 20MB. We provide the bounding boxes obtained by our detector for training/validation/test sets. The participants are also allowed to employ their own face detectors. Except for the face detectors, any external datasets and models are not allowed. Any test augmentation and multi-model ensemble strategy is also not allowed. During the validation phase, each team could send a compressed file (.</description>
