      <description>Training data The dataset is an incremental of JD-landmark [1-7], consisting of about 20,000 images with 106-point landmark annotation. Different to JD-landmark, all of the incremental samples are real-world data with human annotation, without any algo-generated ones. The images and landmarks will be released on March 30, 2020.
Validation data It consists of 2,000 images, which are selected from open source web face dataset [8] and cover large variations of pose, expression and occlusion.</description>

      <description>Detail Requirements  The upper bound of computational complexity is 1 GFLOPs. The upper bound of model size is 20MB. We provide the bounding boxes obtained by our detector for training/validation/test sets. The participants are also allowed to employ their own face detectors. Except for the face detectors, any external datasets and models are not allowed. Any test augmentation and multi-model ensemble strategy are not allowed, either. During the validation phase, each team could send a compressed file (.</description>
